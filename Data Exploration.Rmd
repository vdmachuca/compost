```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(loopr)
```

I will know graph gas emissions over time, to get a sense of any patterns that may be present.

```{r}
compost_GHG <- read_csv("~/Desktop/MATH183_Modeling/Project/compost/compost-GHG.csv")
```

I am interested in O2 and NH3 levels in particular. 

```{r}
ggplot(compost_GHG,aes(x='Julian Day',y="Chamber Number"))+geom_point()
```
